<h2 align="center">Responsive Design</h2>

The website was designed with mobile first usage in mind. All pages used media queries, but the nav bar used bootstrap.

All items move around each other, keep their original view but change size to suit. The nav bar has a handburger menu that when the screen goes smaller it comes out, once clicked the nav links appear.

<h2 align="center">Icons</h2>
  
The website uses icons from font awesome for social media links in the footers and on the contact and form page.

<h2 align="center">Images</h2>
  
All photos were taken from a google search, photoshop was used to change their size and crop them to keep uneeded size down.

<h2 align="center">Color scheme</h2>

The site had two a color scheme of standard black and a nice shade of green #CCF381, these passed all contrast checks with AAA.


<h2 align="center">Validation</h2>

Fixed all errors for the css and html files and passed the validators, the contrast was checked and passed also. I could not get rid of 1 error in eslint, I tried all alternative lines from what I could research at the moment, but have not had any result, the code functions perfectly and smoothly, I will be coming back to this until it is fixed.
